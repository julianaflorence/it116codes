        the met gala this year was absoultley terrible this year and we should be 
        able to ban all celeberties! gilded glamour was literally 
        so easy and simple and yet they still did terrible. whats 
        crazy is that any normal person who enojoyed fashion wouldve killed
        it with a $40 budget and the goodwill!
